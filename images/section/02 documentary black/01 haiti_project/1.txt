<p>The Haiti Project
<br />Prior to the earthquake in January 2010, Haiti had approximately 300,000 children who had been sold, kidnapped or given into a life of slavery. They are known as "Restaveks" - children who 'stay with' another family. These children mostly come from very poor families, particularly from the slums or rural areas of Haiti, who often are no longer able to care for their child, and they are given to families that are marginally better off.
<br />The concept began as a positive idea where the parents simply wanted a better life for their child, food clothing and an education. Most children, however are used as slaves and are not sent to school, nor fed very well. Some are raped, almost all are beaten daily, and many are killed from the abuse.
<br />Since the earthquake in January 2010, U.N. experts estimate there to be over one million children who lost at least one parent in the earthquake or were separated from their families. There are many more children now at risk of child trafficking than ever before. The work of the Haiti Project seeks to help these lost children of Haiti, in a time more critical than ever.

<br />Foyer L'Escale orphanage, is the orphanage I have been supporting since my visit in 2006. Dr. Nadine Burdet's work there proved to be work, which I found, had the most integrity of all places I visited.  She not only provided the restaveks shelter and food, she provided them with psychological and medical care, a self sustaining food program, growing their own food and using chickens eggs for protein rather than eating the chickens.  She diligently attempted to reunite children with their biological families and where those families either no longer existed or could not afford to take their children back she continued to help those children in her care.  L'Escale is still currently running and now providing help to children separated from their parents.  Nadine's dream when I last saw her was to have more space and more resources so that she could take more children.
<br />Funded by donations, Foyer L'Escale shelter rescues, rehabilitates and educates former child slaves for up to a year with the goal of returning them to their families.
