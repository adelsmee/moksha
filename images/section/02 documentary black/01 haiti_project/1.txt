<h3>The Haiti Project</h3> 
<p> 
Prior to the earthquake in January 2010, Haiti had approximately 300,000 children who had been sold, kidnapped or given into a life of slavery.  They are known as "Restaveks" - children who 'stay with' another family.  These children mostly come from very poor families, particularly from the slums or rural areas of Haiti, who often are no longer able to care for their child, and they are given to families that are marginally better off.  The concept began as a positive idea where the parents simply wanted a better life for their child, food clothing and an education.  Most children, however are used as slaves and do not get sent to school, nor are they fed very well.  Some are raped, almost all are beaten daily, and many are killed from the abuse.  Since the earthquake in January, U.N. experts estimate there may be over one million children who have lost at least one parent in the earthquake or are separated from their families. There are many more children now at risk of child trafficking than ever before.  The work of the Haiti Project seeks to help these lost children of Haiti, in a time more critical than ever.
