Sherley is 8 years old.  Before she came to the orphanage ‘Foyer des Enfants’ she was a Restavek, as are many of the children who live here.  She now enjoys living at the orphanage and wishes one day to become a teacher.  Her knees show the results of a typical punishment imposed on Restaveks.  ‘Graze’ is when a child is made to kneel on salt crystals or the metal bar between chair legs for hours at a time. When the children eventually are allowed to stand their knees are often bleeding.
