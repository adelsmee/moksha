The following day, human skulls were found dumped near where the ceremony was held.  
The Haitian police reported that the skulls were suspected to be related to Vodou and connected to the events of the previous night, once again in an attempt to damage Vodou’s reputation.  This sort of accusation is the reason the Vodouist community is frightened to expose their beliefs openly and why they have had the clandestine gatherings, in the past.
