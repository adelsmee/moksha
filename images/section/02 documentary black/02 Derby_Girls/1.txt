<p>Derby Girls
<br />
Derby Girls is an expos&#233; of the raw expression found in this full-contact team sport. The fearless participants and avid followers 'pack' an attitude that's clearly not left at the door! This series provides an insight into a niche sport and a melting pot of eclectic fringe cultures, such as rockabilly, psychobilly and punk. 
<br />
The game is a fiercely fought competition of physical ability and visual splendour. The objective is to win with maximum impact whilst heeding the unspoken precedent of cheeky exuberance. Roller derby is a tremendously empowering and exciting sport for women, filled with an eccentricity and playfulness that entertains on and off the rink. This spectacle is a documentary photographer's playground. The images attempt to capture the energetic passion of the players and the unpredictability of the game, whilst offering a glimpse into the world of gutsy gals and the way they play.
